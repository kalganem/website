**Kaleidoscope** is an interactive R Shiny web application that provides a platform for an easy access to biological databases and bioinformatics tools via a user-friendly interface that could be explored by researchers to test hypothesis in silico. Fully utilizing these robust bioinformatics tools and rich biological databases, interesting information can be obtained that could be very valuable to the field of biological psychiatry. The observations obtained from this platform could supplement existing hypotheses, spawn new ones and possibly direct future studies.
