The Cognitive Disorders Research Laboratory (**CDRL**) is located in the Department of Neurosciences at the University of Toledo Medical Center. The mission of the **CDRL** is to explore the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders with marked cognitive deficits. The laboratory is currently focused on testing specific hypotheses related to schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. We hypothesize that changes in glutamate reuptake are altered in both of these illnesses, reflecting abnormalities of the expression, localization, and function of glutamate transporters. [Robert McCullumsmith MD/PhD](/authors/rob) Director of the **CDRL** and Chair of the Department of Neurosciences, is a board certified psychiatrist who will see patients at the University of Toledo in the Department of Psychiatry. The overarching goal of the **CDRL** is to ask and answer the largest possible questions in translational neuroscience, using a combination of human postmortem brain tissues and animal models to test specific hypotheses related to the pathophysiology of disease.
