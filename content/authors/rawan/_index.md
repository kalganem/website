I received my BS in Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2014 from King Saud University. In 2018, I earned my Master’s in Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Toledo where I studied the involvement of cytoskeletal protein drebrin in microglial activation and inflammation. In 2018, I started my doctoral studies in Neuroscience and Neurological Disorders and joined the Cognitive Disorders Research Laboratory (CDRL). Currently, I’m studying the effect of nitric oxide overexpression on synaptic proteome in schizophrenia pathophysiology.
