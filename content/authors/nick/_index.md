Nicholas graduated from Miami University in 2016 where he worked under Dr. Lori Isaacson, Ph.D. as an Undergraduate Student and a Laboratory Technician. There, he studied the mechanism of glial plasticity in the intermediolateral cell column of spinal cord after sympathetic axotomy. He worked specifically on oligodendrocyte-astrocyte communication and glial proliferation after axotomy. Likewise, he studied the impact of attenuating microglial activation on long-term neuron and glial plasticity after injury.


He is a first-year Graduate Student in the MD-PhD Program at the University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences. In the Cognitive Disorders Research Laboratory, he is currently studying alterations in nutrient sensing by AMPK and AKT in Alzheimerâ€™s Dementia.
