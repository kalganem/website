      <description>&lt;p&gt;Adam received his undergraduate degree in Biology from the University of Nevada Reno (2004). After graduation he accepted a research assistant position with a local biotech company, Sierra Sciences, where he performed research related to telomere biology and telomerase activation. Adam was then accepted into the Neurobiology graduate program at the University of Alabama Birmingham (2006) where he joined the lab of Drs. McCullumsmith and Meador-Woodruff studying the neurobiology of schizophrenia. For his dissertation work, Adam found abnormalities in multiple intracellular signaling cascades in postmortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving his PhD (2011), Adam joined the lab of Dr. DeSilva as a postdoctoral fellow studying the role of glutamate in oligodendrocyte development and demyelinating disease. Adam joined Dr. McCullumsmith in Cincinnati in 2014 as a postdoctoral fellow to perform proteomic analyses of postsynaptic density proteins. Dr. Funk joined the faculty at the University of Toledo Medical Center as a Research Assistant Professor in August of 2018 to continue studying the protein-protein interactions of PSD-95 (a major scaffolding and trafficking protein in the postsynaptic density) in postmortem human tissue. The goal of his research is to employ proteomic approaches to hypotheses of synaptic abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emily earned a BS in neurobiology from the University of Cincinnati in 2016.  During her undergraduate career, she spent two years researching Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease where she analyzed ultrasonic vocalizations in rat models as a way to study dysarthria and cognitive function during disease progression.  Emily joined the Cognitive Disorders Research Laboratory in September 2016 and quickly became the lead laser capture microdissection technician, using this technique along with QPCR to explore glutamate transported expression in schizophrenia.  In the summer of 2018, Emily will relocate to the University of Toledo Medical Center in August of 2018 where she continue her work with the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. McCullumsmith studied biochemistry (BS) at Indiana University, then pursued joint MD, PhD degrees at the University of Michigan. Following a research-track residency in Psychiatry at the University of Michigan, he joined the faculty and began to study abnormalities of glutamate transporter expression in severe mental illness. Dr. McCullumsmith was promoted to Associate Professor with Tenure while at the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobiology at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He relocated to the University of Cincinnati in 2013 where he served as the Associate Vice Chair for Translational Research at UC and the Medical Director of the Outpatient Mental health Division at the Cincinnati VAMC. In 2017 he was promoted to full Professor with tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. McCullumsmith and his team relocated to the University of Toledo Medical Center in August of 2018, where he now serves as the Chair of the Department of Neurosciences, as well as the Research Director of the Neurosciences Institute at UTMC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sinead received her undergraduate degree in Neurosciences from Trinity College, the University of Dublin, Ireland.  She conducted her PhD thesis, &amp;ldquo;The Molecular, Cellular and Behavioral Effects of Electroconvulsive Stimulation in the Rodent,&amp;rdquo; with the Neurobiology of Depression research group in the Depat. of Psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin.  This project examined the effects of electroconvulsive stimulation on rat hippocampal and frontal cortex proteomes.  It also established a novel animal model of ECS administration, ultra-brief pulse stimulation, to aid in studying the parameters of this treatment for severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Sinead joined the McCullumsmith laboratory in the Dept. of Psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati as a postdoctoral fellow, continuing her work in translational neuroscience.  This research focused on abnormalities of glutamate transporters (EAAT2) in schizophrenia, using postmortem tissue. It also highlighted the necessity of examining cell-specific and subcellular-level alterations in molecular systems in severe mental illness.  Using methods such as laser capture microdissection, significant, cell-subtype specific changes in EAAT2 and it&amp;rsquo;s splice variants, particularly EAAT2b, were identified in corticothalamic regions in schizophrenia.  In addition, she is interested in the aberrant metabolism of the adenosine system in disease.  Adenosine modulates the glutamate and dopamine neurotransmitter systems which are dysregulated in schizophrenia and contribute to the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2018, Sinead will take up a position of Research Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Neurosciences at The University of Toledo, continuing her research in dysregulated molecular mechanisms of severe mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
